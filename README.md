# form-validation
It's one of my projects for Daneshkar Course part 6 to learn how to make a validation form using JS.

This ia a responsive validation form.
You can write your name using less than 15 English characters, a valid email type and a password contains more than 8 characters, lower and UPPER case chracters and numbers.
When you click on submit button, we welcome you for coming back :)
